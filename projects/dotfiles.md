# my-dotfiles-and-macos-defaults

### source code: [click](https://github.com/nynniaw12/dotfiles/tree/main)

My .config folder for setting up a development environment with nvim, tmux, wezterm, and more.

The dotfiles are relatively configured and inspired from ThePrimagen, Suttle MacOS Defaults
and with personal additions these include most importantly the package manager of choice the fast Lazy,
tmux, wezterm (fabulous terminal emulator written in Rust) many of tpope's wonderful vim plugins such as
commentary, vinegar, and surround,the lualine, noice, vimtex for editing LaTex,
,silicon for sharing code snippets (please check its own dependencies), and 
pandoc and lynx to preview .md files.
